UBC Engineering Physics Autonomous Robots Annual Competition 2018 - Star Wars Rescue <br/>
This robot placed **2nd overall** <br/>

## Main Objective
For the first half of the course this robot sits ontop of the bottom bot. It's job is to communicate to the bottom robot to tell it when to stop, when it detects a ewok, or cliff, and tells it when to drop the bottom bridge. It has the responsibility of picking up all the ewoks, and storing them. Once the first part of the course is complete and the bottom bot had lined up for deployment the top bot detatches and finishes the rest of the course leaving the bottom bot behind. During this time it needs to use its sensors to navigate to find ewoks, navigate the circular towers, follow the edge across the suspension bridge, line up and deploy its bridges to cross the second gap, and dump the ewoks it picked up during the course back into the start area.

## Features
* FULLY AUTONOMOUS
* Edge following
* Cliff detecting
* Claw with IR detectors to find and pick up ewoks
* Claw is on vertical linear drive allowing it to accomidate both bottom and top bots
* LCD to access menu for on the go tuning
* Stoage system with dump capabilities
* Deploys 2 plank bridges
* Detatches from bottom bot

### This code was being run on the TINAH board, which is esentially an Arduino Uno sheild
